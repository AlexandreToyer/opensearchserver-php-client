### How to install it

Add the repository information in your `composer.json` file:
``` 
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/jaeksoft/opensearchserver-php-client"
  }
],
```

Add the require information in your `composer.json` file:
```
"opensearchserver/opensearchserver": "~2.0-dev"
``` 

Run `composer install` (or `php composer.phar install`).

### How to use it

Create an OSS_API instance:
```php
$oss_url = 'http://localhost:8080';
$oss_index = 'my_index';
$oss_login = 'my_login';
$oss_key = '54a51de4f27cefbcb7a771335b980567f'
$oss_api = new \Opensearchserver\OssApi($oss_url, $oss_index, $oss_login, $oss_key);
```

To make a search, we need an OssSearch instance:
```php
$oss_search = $oss_api->search();
```

Searching the keyword "open", using the search template called "search", using a time-out of 60 seconds:
```php
$xmlResult = $oss_search->query('open')
    ->template('search')
    ->execute(60);
```

Get the number of documents found (using OssResults class):
```php
$oss_result = new \Opensearchserver\OssResults($xmlResult);
$doc_found_number = $oss_result->getResultFound() - $oss_result->getResultCollapsedCount();
print 'Documents found: '.$doc_found_number."\n";
```

Iterate over the documents and print the title:
```php
for ($i = 0; $i < $doc_found_number; $i++) {
  $title = $oss_result->getField($i, 'title');
  print '#'.$i.' '.$title."\n";
}
```
